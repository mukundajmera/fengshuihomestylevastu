## OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### Price Objection:
```
I completely understand. Let me put this in perspective:

A traditional Vastu consultant might suggest:
❌ Breaking walls (₹2-5 lakhs)
❌ Structural changes (₹5-10 lakhs)
❌ Demolition & reconstruction (₹10-50+ lakhs)

My Scientific Remote Approach:
✅ Zero demolition
✅ Simple remedies (₹5,000-50,000 max)
✅ 100% remote (no travel costs)
✅ Proven results (10,000+ success stories)

Investment: [Consultation Fee]
Potential ROI: Infinite (considering avoided demolition costs)

Would you prefer to proceed now, or would you like me to share some case studies of clients with similar budgets?
```

### "I Need to Think About It" Objection:
```
Absolutely! This is an important decision.

While you're considering, may I share:

1. What specific aspect would you like more clarity on?
   □ Process & methodology
   □ Expected outcomes
   □ Implementation timeline
   □ Investment vs. results

2. Would a quick 10-minute FREE discovery call help?
   • I can answer all your questions
   • Provide a preliminary assessment
   • Explain the exact process
   • No obligation to book

3. Meanwhile, let me send you:
   ✅ Client success stories (similar to your case)
   ✅ Sample Vastu report (redacted)
   ✅ FAQ document

How soon would you like to revisit this? I want to ensure you make the most informed decision!
```

### "Can You Give a Discount?" Objection:
```
I appreciate your interest! 

My consultation fee reflects 25+ years of expertise and the precision of scientific remote analysis that prevents costly mistakes.

However, I can offer:

🎁 VALUE-ADDS (instead of discount):
✅ Extended follow-up (30 → 45 days)
✅ Bonus: Elemental color guide for your space
✅ Priority scheduling
✅ Free annual review call (worth [Amount])

OR
