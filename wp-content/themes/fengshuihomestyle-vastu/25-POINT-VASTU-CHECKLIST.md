## SECTION 1: DIRECTIONAL ALIGNMENT (8 Points)

### 1. True North Identification
**Question:** Have you determined the True North (not Magnetic North) of your property using satellite/GPS tools?

- [ ] YES - I have accurate True North alignment
- [ ] NO - I'm using a compass or not sure

**Why it matters:** All directional placements depend on accurate North identification.

**Quick Remedy:** Use Google Earth or GPS compass app to find True North. Magnetic compasses can be 5-20° off.

---

### 2. Main Entrance Direction
**Question:** Is your main entrance located in North, East, or North-East direction?

- [ ] YES - Entrance in auspicious direction
- [ ] NO - Entrance in South, South-West, or West

**Why it matters:** Entrance governs opportunities and energy inflow.

**Quick Remedy:** If South/SW entrance, place a bright light, nameplate with family name, and keep area clutter-free.

---

### 3. Kitchen Placement
**Question:** Is your kitchen located in South-East (Fire zone)?

- [ ] YES - Kitchen in ideal SE direction
- [ ] NO - Kitchen in NE, SW, or other directions

**Why it matters:** SE is the Fire element zone, perfect for cooking.

**Quick Remedy:** If NE kitchen (worst case), use salt lamps, keep extremely clean, and cook facing East. Consult expert for detailed remedies.

---

### 4. Master Bedroom Location
**Question:** Is your master bedroom in South-West direction?

- [ ] YES - Master bedroom in SW (ideal)
- [ ] NO - Master bedroom in NE, SE, or other zones

**Why it matters:** SW represents stability, grounding, and marital harmony.

**Quick Remedy:** If bedroom elsewhere, use heavy furniture in SW corner of the room, earth-tone colors, and place bed head towards South/West.

---

### 5. North-East Zone Clarity
**Question:** Is your North-East zone (spirituality corner) clutter-free, bright, and ideally has a prayer room or open space?

- [ ] YES - NE zone is clean and open
- [ ] NO - NE has heavy furniture, toilet, or storage

**Why it matters:** NE is the most sacred direction in Vastu; blockages create mental stress.

**Quick Remedy:** Declutter immediately. Add plants, natural light, or a small water feature. Avoid storing junk here.

---

### 6. South Wall Utilization
**Question:** Is your South wall heavy (bookcases, cabinets) or South rooms used for fame-related activities (home office, awards display)?

- [ ] YES - South is appropriately utilized
- [ ] NO - South has windows/doors or is empty

**Why it matters:** South should be heavier than North for stability and recognition.

**Quick Remedy:** Add heavy furniture, closed cabinets, or display achievements on South wall.

---

### 7. Brahmasthan (Center) Status
**Question:** Is the center of your home kept open, light, and free from heavy furniture, pillars, or toilets?

- [ ] YES - Center is clear
- [ ] NO - Center has obstructions

**Why it matters:** Center is the energy vortex; blockages drain vitality.

**Quick Remedy:** Remove furniture from exact center. Use this space for meditation or keep it empty with minimal décor.

---

### 8. Water Element Placement
**Question:** Are water features (overhead tank, aquarium, fountain) located in North, East, or North-East?

- [ ] YES - Water in correct zones
- [ ] NO - Water in South, SW, or SE

**Why it matters:** Water activates career and financial flow when placed correctly.

**Quick Remedy:** If water in wrong zone, balance with Earth element (clay pots, yellow décor) in that area.

---

## SECTION 2: ROOM-SPECIFIC CHECKS (7 Points)

### 9. Bedroom Head Direction
**Question:** When sleeping, does your head point towards South or West (feet towards North/East)?

- [ ] YES - Head towards S or W
- [ ] NO - Head towards N or E

**Why it matters:** Sleeping with head towards North conflicts with Earth's magnetic field, causing restlessness.

**Quick Remedy:** Rotate bed so head is towards South (best) or West.

---

**Question:** Are toilets NOT located in North-East, South-West, or exact center of the home?

- [ ] YES - Toilets in acceptable zones (NW, SE, East, South)

**Question:** Does your study/office desk face North or East while working?

- [ ] YES - Desk faces N or E

**Question:** Are children's rooms in West or North-West direction?

- [ ] YES - Children's rooms in W or NW
- [ ] NO - Children's rooms in SW or SE
